# Pirate-Launcher
Launcher for The Legends of Pirates Online developed in Java.

### Windows
It works out of the box on Windows. All you need is Java. 

### Linux
On Linux, you need to install some libraries to launch TLOPO.
You can just run `./tlopo` after you have downloaded the game. 
It should throw out the libraries you need to get as errors.
`libpng12` and `libssl1.0.0` are the only two I know.
If you find additional libraries, please share them.

### Macintosh
This launcher might have Apple Macintosh support. I don't own a Macintosh to test it on.
